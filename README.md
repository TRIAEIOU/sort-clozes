# Sort clozes

[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net) addon ([GitHub](https://github.com/TRIAEIOU/sort-clozes)) to sort clozes in notes in ascending order while keeping stats/learning state.

## Warning

I have tested this addon to a reasonable extent, however take care if you have large collections with long running stats. Make a backup (the addon creates one as well for this reason) and try on a few notes to verify it does what you want before running it on the root of your collection. I made this for my personal use and share it so that others may benefit if it suits them, I do not take responsibility for anything!

## Use

Use `Sort clozes` from main window toolbar `Tools` or from context menu in the Browser sidebar or table (requires 1+ notes/cards to be selected) to sort all cloze notes in selection/selected deck (including subdecks).

- The addon will sort all clozes on all cloze notes with at least one card in the selection.
- Note that the note/card table is not updated, select another deck (so that the table updates) to see the result.
- A backup is created automatically prior to sorting (unless no changes has been made since the last backup).
